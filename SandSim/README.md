# Sebastian's Miscellaneous Projects

Hello and welcome! This is a storage repo for some of my more interesting personal projects which dont deserve their full own repo.

If you would  like to look at my python command line menu wrapper library for Curses, look in my profile for the CLI repo. That project was a way to ease menu creation for my terminal based curses projects. That was another spot to learn more about objects and higher-order functions.

Files included here:
- 3dscene.js, modeling.js, primitives.js, and spinningcoordinates.js are all written for 3js. They are a self-built renderer for cubes.
- SandSim is a p5js project that is a somewhat physics-based sand simulator. Each sand block is represented by an object and has a controllable weight which adjusts how much sand it can hold above it before it moves to the side. This again taught me a lot about objects and how to deal with large quantities of objects.
